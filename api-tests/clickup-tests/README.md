# ClickUp API Test Suite

Automated API test suite for the ClickUp platform, validating task management functionality in detail.

---

## Key Metrics

* **43 API requests** – covering complete task management workflow
* **26s 25ms** – total collection execution time
* **100% Success Rate** – all tests completed successfully
* **6 functional modules** – Authentication, Spaces, Folders, Lists, Tasks, Comments

## Testing Approach

### "Granular Validation" Method

* **Sequential testing** – tests executed in specific order with dependencies
* **Multi-level assertions** – each request contains 5–10 different tests
* **Dynamic environment variables** – state storage between requests
* **Modular structure** – logical functionality grouping

### Validation Structure

Each request is validated with multiple tests:

* **Status Code** (200, 201, 204)
* **Response Time** (< 2000-5000ms)
* **Content-Type** (application/json)
* **JSON Structure Validation**
* **Business Logic Verification**
* \*\*Data Integrity Checks

## Functional Scope

### Management Hierarchy

* **Spaces** – project containers with status and permission configuration
* **Folders** – project organization with create, update, delete, and verify tests
* **Lists** – task structures with templates, folderless lists
* **Tasks** – full CRUD with assignments, attachments, priorities, tags, dates, and estimates
* **Comments** – comment system with threads, resolving, and length tests

### Boundary and Quality Testing

* **Unicode Support** – Chinese characters, Polish diacritics, emoji in titles and descriptions
* **Boundary Testing** – long descriptions (30,000 characters), numeric names, extreme values
* **Multi-List Operations** – adding tasks to multiple lists simultaneously
* **Attachment Management** – file upload with metadata validation

---

## Technology Stack

* **Postman** – test framework with JavaScript pre/post-request scripts
* **ClickUp API v2** – REST endpoints with full functionality
* **Environment Variables** – dynamic test data management during execution
* **Collection Runners** – sequential execution with dependency management
