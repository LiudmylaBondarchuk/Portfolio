# ClickUp API Test Suite

Automated API test suite for the ClickUp platform, based on detailed validation of task management functionality elements.

## Key Metrics
- **382 automated tests** - precise validation of each function
- **43 API requests** - covering complete task management workflow
- **27s 859ms** - total collection execution time
- **100% Success Rate** - all tests completed successfully
- **6 functional modules** - Authentication, Spaces, Folders, Lists, Tasks, Comments

## Quick Access
- **Test Results** - full report from last run
- **Download Collection** - import to Postman
- **Technical README** - detailed configuration documentation

## Testing Approach

### "Granular Validation" Method
- **Sequential testing** - tests executed in specific order with dependencies
- **Multi-level assertions** - each request contains 5-10 different tests
- **Dynamic environment variables** - state storage between requests
- **Modular structure** - logical functionality grouping

### Validation Structure
```
Each Request = Multiple Tests:
├── Status Code (200, 201, 204)
├── Response Time (< 2000-5000ms)
├── Content-Type (application/json)
├── JSON Structure Validation
├── Business Logic Verification
└── Data Integrity Checks
```

## Functional Scope

### Management Hierarchy
- **Spaces** - project containers with status and permission configuration
- **Folders** - project organization with create, update, delete, and verify tests
- **Lists** - task structures with templates, folderless lists
- **Tasks** - full CRUD with assignments, attachments, priorities, tags, dates, and estimates
- **Comments** - comment system with threads, resolving, and length tests

### Boundary and Quality Testing
- **Unicode Support** - Chinese characters, Polish diacritics, emoji in titles and descriptions
- **Boundary Testing** - long descriptions (30,000 characters), numeric names, extreme values
- **Multi-List Operations** - adding tasks to multiple lists simultaneously
- **Attachment Management** - file upload with metadata validation

## Technology Stack
- **Postman** - test framework with JavaScript pre/post-request scripts
- **ClickUp API v2** - REST endpoints with full functionality
- **Environment Variables** - dynamic test data management during execution
- **Collection Runners** - sequential execution with dependency management
