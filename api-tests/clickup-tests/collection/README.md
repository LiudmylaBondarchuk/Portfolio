Detailed documentation for running and configuring the ClickUp API test collection.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

### 1. ClickUp Account

**Template List in ClickUp**
1. Create a **new list** in your Workspace
2. Go to **List Settings â†’ Advanced**
3. Click **"Save as Template"**

**Step 2: Create environment - Add required variables:**

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| clickUpBaseUrl | https://api.clickup.com/api/v2 |
| clickUpApiToken | pk_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE |

Remaining variables are created dynamically during tests and pre-requests - no prior manual addition required.

**Step 3: Activate environment**

If configured correctly, all tests should pass with 100% success rate. The collection runs approximately 43 requests in ~27 seconds with built-in rate limiting.
